# Deep Learning: Cytopathic Effect Approach
The repository contains preliminary code to utilize deep learning approach for automated detection and counting of CPE in cell culture images.

**CPE Image Analysis**

This repository contains code and resources for the analysis of cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture images. The project utilizes image processing techniques to identify and count CPE areas, providing a tool for researchers and clinicians to quantify viral infections' impact on cell cultures.

### Objective

Cytopathic effects (CPE) are changes in host cells due to viral infections that can be observed under a microscope. Quantifying these changes is crucial in virology research and for the diagnosis of viral infections. This project provides a set of tools for automated detection and counting of CPE in cell culture images.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
