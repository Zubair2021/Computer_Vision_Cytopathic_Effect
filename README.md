## CPE Image Analysis

### Introduction

Cytopathic effects (CPE) are changes in host cells due to viral infections that can be observed under a microscope. Quantifying these changes is crucial in virology research and for the diagnosis of viral infections. This project provides a set of tools for automated detection and counting of CPE in cell culture images.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
```

#### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPE-Image-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd CPE-Image-Analysis
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the script, navigate to the source code directory and execute the main Python file:

```bash
python cpe_analysis.py
```

### Code Structure

- `cpe_analysis.py`: The main script that performs image preprocessing, segmentation, and counting of CPE areas.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions for image processing.
- `data/`: Sample images for testing the analysis script.
- `models/`: Trained model files (if applicable).
